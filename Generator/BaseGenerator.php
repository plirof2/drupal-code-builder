/**
 * Abstract base Generator for components.
 *
 * (This named to distinguish it from the Base Task clas.)
 *
 * The generator process works over three phases:
 *  - a tree of generators is gathered
 *  - a list of file info is built up, with each generator allowed to contribute
 *  - the file info is processed and returned for the caller to output
 *
 * @section sec_gather_generators Gathering generators
 * The generator system starts with a particular generator for a
 * given component (e.g., 'module'), and then adding generators this one
 * requests, recursing this process into each new generator and building a tree
 * down from the original one. This is done by Generate::assembleComponentList()
 * which gathers all the required components in a cascade. Each class implements
 * requiredComponents() to return a list of child components. The process ends
 * when the added generators are themselves one that return no sub-components.
 *
 * So for example, the caller requests a 'module' component. This causes the
 * entry point to the system, DrupalCodeBuilder\Task\Generate::generateComponent(),
 * to instantiate a module generator, which is then interrogated for its
 * subcomponents. It returns, say, that it needs:
 *  - a README file
 *  - a .info file
 *  - hooks, which is an abstract component which represents the module's code
 *    which we are to generate.
 * The first two components are terminal: they do not have subcomponents of
 * their own. The hooks component however adds more generators: a code file
 * generator for each file it needs for the hooks it has been requested to
 * generate. The code files are then interrogated, and return no subcomponents:
 * the gathering process is thus complete.
 *
 * The end result is a flat list of components, keyed by component names. Each
 * component has the data it needs to operate.
 *
 * @section sec_assemble_tree Assemble component tree
 * The list of components is iterated over in assembleComponentTree() to
 * assemble a tree structure of the components, where child components are those
 * that are contained by their parents. For example, the module code file
 * contains functions and hook implementations.
 *
 * This tree is iterated over again in buildComponentContentsIterative() to allow
 * file components in the tree to gather data from their child components.
 *
 * @section sec_assemble_file_info Collect file info
 * We then recurse down the tree in collectFiles(), building up
 * an array of file info that we pass by reference (this it can be altered
 * as well as added to, though generator order is TBFO). Generator classes that
 * wish to output a file should implement getFileInfo().
 *
 * @section sec_assemble_files Assemble files
 * Finally, we assemble the file info into filenames and code, ready for the
 * initiator of the whole process (e.g., Drush, Drupal UI) to output them in an
 * appropriate way. This is done in Generate::assembleFiles().
 *
 * There are three distinct hierarchies at work here:
 *  - A plain PHP class hierarchy, which is just there to allow us to make use
 *    of method inheritance. So for instance, ModuleCodeFile inherits from File.
 *    This is just for code re-use.
 *  - A hierarchy formed by components that request other components in turn.
 *    This fans out from the initially requested root component, e.g. 'module'.
 *    This is based on how things fit together conceptually: a module may need
 *    hooks, and a hook implementation needs a file it can go in. The same
 *    component may appear at different parts of the request hierarchy.
 *  - The tree of components that is assembled prior to building code. This is
 *    purely to do with containment. Thus, a code file contains its functions.
 *    This comes into play when a component is building its code, and may
 *    interrogate its child components in this hierarchy to have them add to
 *    what it provides.

   *  - data that must be specified by the user
   *  - data that may be specified by the user, but can be computed or take from
   *    defaults
   *  - data that should not be specified by the user, as it is computed from
   *    other input.
   *
   * This array must be processed in the order in which the properties are
   * given, so that the callables for defaults and options work properly.
   *
   * Note this can't be a class property due to use of closures.
   *
   * @return
   *  An array that defines the data this component needs to operate. The order
   *  is important, as callbacks may depend on component data that has been
   *  assembled so far, i.e., on data properties that are earlier in the array.
   *  Each key corresponds to a key for a property in the $component_data that
   *  should be passed to this class's __construct(). Each value is an array,
   *  with the following keys:
   *  - 'label': A human-readable label for the property.
   *  - 'description': (optional) A longer description of the property.
   *  - 'format': (optional) Specifies the expected format for the property. If
   *    omitted, defaults to 'string'.
   *    Possible values are:
   *    - 'string': The property's data should be a plain string.
   *    - 'boolean': The property's data should be a boolean.
   *    - 'array': The property's data should be an array of string values. The
   *      keys are ignored.
   *    - 'compound': The property's data should be an array where each element
   *      is a further array of properties. The keys are ignored. The values in
   *      each array are specified by calling this method on the class
   *      determined from the 'component' property.
   *  - 'default': (optional) The default value for the property. This is either
   *    a static value, or a callable, in which case it must be called with the
   *    array of component data assembled so far. Depending on the value of
   *    'required', this represents either the value that may be presented as a
   *    default to the user in a UI for convenience, or the value that will be
   *    set if nothing is provided when instatiating the component. Note that
   *    this is required if a later property makes use of this property in a
   *    callback, as non-progressive UIs can only rely on hardcoded default
   *    values.
   *  - 'required': (optional) Boolean indicating whether this property must be
   *    provided. Defaults to FALSE.
   *  - 'process_default': (optional) Boolean indicating if TRUE that this
   *    property will have the default value set on it if it is empty in the
   *    process stage. This is different from 'required', in that the user may
   *    leave this empty. The purpose of this is for properties where in the
   *    absence of user input, we can derive a sensible value, but we choose to
   *    allow the user to override this. For example, the description on
   *    permissions, which can be derived from the machine name. Defaults to
   *    FALSE.
   *  - 'options': (optional) A callable which returns a list of options for the
   *    property. This receives the component data assembled so far.
   *  - 'options_structured': (optional) A callable which returns data about the
   *    possible options for the property. Use this as an alternative to the
   *    'options' property if you want more information. This returns an array
   *    keyed by group name (where the group is possibly the module that
   *    defines the option), whose values are arrays keyed by the options. Each
   *    value is a further array with these properties:
   *      - 'description': A longer description of the item.
   *  - 'options_allow_other': (optional) If TRUE, specifies that values outside
   *    the list of options are allowable.
   *  - 'processing': (optional) A callback to processComponentData() to use to
   *    process input values into the final format for the component data array.
   *  - 'component': (optional) The name of a generator class, relative to the
   *    namespace. If present, this results in child components of this class
   *    being added to the component tree. The handling of this is determined
   *    by the component class's requestedComponentHandling() method.
   *  - 'computed': (optional) If TRUE, indicates that this property is computed
   *    by the component, and should not be obtained from the user.
